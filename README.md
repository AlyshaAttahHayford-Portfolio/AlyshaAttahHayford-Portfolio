- 👋 Hi there, I’m Alysha Attah-Hayford and this is my first analytics portfolio. I intend to use it to showcase some of the coding and data analysis skills I've learnt through my internships, at university and in my spare time.  
- 👀 I’m currently interested in finding entry level or junior level employement within data analytics or business analytics spaces in the UK. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write queries using SQL and manipulate large datasets using Python code. I'm also trying to get more adept at data visualisation and I've continually been improving my skills on PowerBI and Tableau.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with prospective employers on any work projects that they may think I'm suitable for. 
- 📫 I can be contacted via my LinkedIn Porfile which is the same name as this portfolio (Alysha Attah-Hayford) or via my email which is alyshaattahhayford@gmail.com
